## Our Open-Source Philosophy

We believe in open-sourcing as much of our works as possible so that others my learn and submit improvements. Many of the tools we use, [including our publishing framework, `time-interactive`](https://github.com/TimeMagazine/time-interactive), are open-sourced under the MIT license in the [Time Labs GitHub organization](https://github.com/TimeMagazine/).

At the same time, the editorial content we produce for Time Magazine and Time.com, much of which is displayed here, requires considerable resources and reporting. We are eager to share the code that goes into producing this work but cannot license it for reproduction. That said, if you see something that you would like to repurpose, it never hurts to ask! E-mail chris.wilson@time.com to discuss.
